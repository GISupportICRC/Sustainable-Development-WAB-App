# Sustainable Development WAB 2.8 App 

The atlas catalogues sustainability initiatives implemented around the world by different humanitarian organisations. 
The sustainability initiatives are colour coded by themes: social (yellow), environmental (green) and economic (blue). 
The aim of the atlas is to make these initiatives more visible and to encourage sharing of sustainability best practices among 
humanitarian organisations.

### UpdatePhotos (Off-panel)

By default, ArcGIS Online and Web App Builder are not prepared to show the attachments as a picture in the popups. We develop a solution 
for solve the problem. Using a get method for fetch the attachments from the server, we post these attachments updating the pictures as a 
'img' html tag in a new string field, this way, the browser can interpret the string as a picture. 
This off-panel widget executes the update at 'startup'.
